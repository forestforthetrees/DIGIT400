# DIGIT 400
## Penn State Behrend
### Digital Media, Arts, and technology

This is a demo site for a minimalist lifestlye website made by Nathaniel White at [Penn State Behrend](http://behrend.psu.edu/).

My site/web application was inspired by the minimalist movement and my own feeling of being overwhelmed with the amount of clutter that I have in my own life and have noticed in product design. My goal with this prototype web application is to inform users about what minimalism can mean and help them potentially find some minimally designed products depending on what they want from minimalism.

## Functionality/Future Functionality
My goal for this site is to create a one stop hub for users to get results, answers, and content regarding the minimalist movement through the use of python libraries and content generated by me.

The central part of this site is going to be the use of Beautiful Soup to search google results and bring back the top result for a store at which you can purchase minimalistic products that have been designed to look simple.

## Libraries Used

```
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
```

### Keep on coding <3
